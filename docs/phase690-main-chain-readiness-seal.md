## Result

## Boundary

This phase is production readiness and integration readiness only. It does not deploy, release, tag, upload artifacts, commit, push, read raw secrets, or modify Codex config/base_url.

## Seal

- main-chain ready means the disabled hook, shadow path, rollback, and kill switch are available.
- It does not mean default main-chain traffic is enabled.
